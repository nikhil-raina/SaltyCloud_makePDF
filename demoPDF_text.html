                    I am from Bangalore, India. Well, originally from the North of India, to be specific: Delhi. However, I shifted
                    from Bangalore from 2nd grade onwards and had been there till I had to leave for University at the age of 18 years.
                    While I was in Bangalore 2 schools, Greenwood High (ICSE) and Canadian International School Bangalore (IB).

                    As far as I remember, I loved to fool around, play around, laugh about with friends and absolutely loved building Lego.
                </p>

                    The very concept of building and creating my own “Master Piece”, in a way at least, was far too entertaining for
                    me to let go. Plus, at that age, children basically needed some good way to kill their time. I would usually do
                    it by playing cricket, swimming, badminton, eating or just building things with Lego like: monuments, guns, robots
                    cars, bikes and buildings. As time went by, my mother and her sisters started to realize my passion and enjoyment
                    towards “playing”, that’s what they would always say… such novice individuals, with Lego, I started to get more
                    and more Lego puzzles. Each increasing in complexity. Eventually I was introduced to Mind Storm, which was a
                    GAME CHANGER!
                    Having been able to literally program your robot and make it move or sense or hold objects, was mind blowing to me

            The tag that ACTS like a button.

            I used a Tag instead of actually using a button because I wanted to experiment a bit more with my
            understanding. This tag can be removed and a button can be kept here where the ".onClick" function can also
            be modified with the function call on this HTML File and the code itself on the JavaScript File.
        -->
        <a id="show-more">Show More</a>

        <!--Below is the commented out example of using a button.-->

            <!--<button id="show-more" onclick="setUpEvents()">Show More</button>-->
