# makePDF
I created this program as a mock PDF maker where I am making use of the KENDO Script for generating the PDF.
This script esentially "draws" the curent page or the required tag section in the PDF.

I have tried to make this mehtod of implementation of the KENDO script as descriptive as possible for the use, so that he or she can 
use it the way the want to. Currently, the Comments within the files are specifically catered to the ISORA Product of SaltyCloud.
